## Systems
The following systems are examples to be able to test new components.

### SystemLaserObstacleAvoidTiagoWebotsSimulator
This system is a copy of the `SystemLaserObstacleAvoidTiagoGazeboSimulator` in order to show that the new components developed to use Webots simulator are working since the robot has the same behavior as expected.

A [TIAGo Iron](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tiago-iron) is used with a lidar that seems to be a [Sick TIM150-3010300](https://www.sick.com/ca/en/detection-and-ranging-solutions/2d-lidar-sensors/tim1xx/tim150-3010300/p/p595144?ff_data=JmZmX2lkPXA1OTUxNDQmZmZfbWFzdGVySWQ9cDU5NTE0NCZmZl90aXRsZT1UaU0xNTAtMzAxMDMwMCZmZl9xdWVyeT0mZmZfcG9zPTImZmZfb3JpZ1Bvcz0yJmZmX3BhZ2U9MSZmZl9wYWdlU2l6ZT0yNCZmZl9vcmlnUGFnZVNpemU9MjQmZmZfc2ltaT05MS4w) with a range of 10 meters and an aperture angle of 200 degree.

### SystemWebotsTiagoNavigation
This system is a copy of the `SystemTiagoNavigation` in order to show that the new components developed to use Webots simulator are working since the robot has the same behavior as expected.
